# Quarto workshop on Open Science Day KU Leuven 2025

by Eline Van Geert and Lisa Koßmann

A hands-on session designed for researchers using Python or R to enhance reproducibility with Quarto. Learn to create reproducible research reports by combining text, code, and code outputs into custom formatted documents, articles, presentations, books, or websites.

## Workshop info

Are you conducting research that includes analyses performed in Python or R? Tired of manually copy-pasting the results from your analysis software to word processors like Word or LaTeX? Learn how to enhance the reproducibility of your work by creating reproducible research reports with Quarto. With Quarto, you directly combine text, code, and code outputs into custom formatted documents (including PDF/Word/HTML reports), articles, presentations, books, or websites. You can even add interactive elements to your documents to help readers explore your results.

In this workshop, we introduce participants to this versatile open-source scientific and technical publishing system. We discuss the basic components of creating a Quarto document, and demonstrate how to render it to different output formats. We also point you to additional resources for more complex uses of Quarto. If possible, please have one of the following editors installed before the workshop: Jupyter, Visual Studio Code, or RStudio (cf. https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
